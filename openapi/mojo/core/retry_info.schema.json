If retrying requests also\nfail, clients should use an exponential backoff scheme to gradually increase\nthe delay between retries based on `retry_delay`, until either a maximum\nnumber of retries have been reached or a maximum retry delay cap has been\nreached.","type":"object","properties":{"retryDelay":{"title":"Duration","description":"Clients should wait at least this long between retrying the same request.","type":"string","format":"Duration"}}}
