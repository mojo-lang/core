It is\ndefined as a string here to accommodate for the possible use of a leading\nzero in the extension (organizations have complete freedom to do so, as\nthere is no standard defined).

There\nhave been plans to migrate fixed-line numbers to start with the digit two\nsince December 2000, but it has not happened yet. See\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2B39 for more details.\n\nThese fields can be safely ignored (there is no need to set them) for most\ncountries. Some limited number of countries behave like Italy - for these\ncases, if the leading zero(s) of a number would be retained even when\ndialling internationally, set this flag to true, and also set the number of\nleading zeros.\n\nClients who use the parsing functionality of the i18n phone\nnumber libraries will have these fields set if necessary automatically.","type":"boolean"},"nationalNumber":{"title":"mojo.core.UInt64","description":"The National (significant) Number, as defined in International\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation E.164, without any leading\nzero. The leading-zero is stored separately if required, since this is an\nuint64 and hence cannot store such information. Do not use this field\ndirectly: if you want the national significant number, call the\ngetNationalSignificantNumber method of PhoneNumberUtil.\n\nFor countries which have the concept of an \"area code\" or \"national\ndestination code\", this is included in the National (significant) Number.\nAlthough the ITU says the maximum length should be 15, we have found longer\nnumbers in some countries e.g. Germany.\nNote that the National (significant) Number does not contain the National\n(trunk) prefix.
