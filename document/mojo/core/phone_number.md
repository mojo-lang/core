| 字段 | 类型 | 格式类型 | 是否必须 | 默认值 | 说明 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `countryCode` | `integer` | `int32` | 否 |  | The country calling code for this number, as defined by the InternationalTelecommunication Union (ITU). For example, this would be 1 for NANPAcountries, and 33 for France. |
| `nationalNumber` | `integer` | `uint64` | 是 |  | The National (significant) Number, as defined in InternationalTelecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation E.164, without any leadingzero. The leading-zero is stored separately if required, since this is anuint64 and hence cannot store such information. Do not use this fielddirectly: if you want the national significant number, call thegetNationalSignificantNumber method of PhoneNumberUtil.<br>For countries which have the concept of an "area code" or "nationaldestination code", this is included in the National (significant) Number.Although the ITU says the maximum length should be 15, we have found longernumbers in some countries e.g. Germany.Note that the National (significant) Number does not contain the National(trunk) prefix. Obviously, as a uint64, it will never contain anyformatting (hyphens, spaces, parentheses), nor any alphanumeric spellings. |
| `extension` | `string` | `` | 否 |  | Extension is not standardized in ITU recommendations, except for beingdefined as a series of numbers with a maximum length of 40 digits. It isdefined as a string here to accommodate for the possible use of a leadingzero in the extension (organizations have complete freedom to do so, asthere is no standard defined). Other than digits, some other diallingcharacters such as "," (indicating a wait) may be stored here. |
| `italianLeadingZero` | `boolean` | `` | 否 |  | In some countries, the national (significant) number starts with one ormore "0"s without this being a national prefix or trunk code of some kind.For example, the leading zero in the national (significant) number of anItalian phone number indicates the number is a fixed-line number.  Therehave been plans to migrate fixed-line numbers to start with the digit twosince December 2000, but it has not happened yet. See for more details.<br>These fields can be safely ignored (there is no need to set them) for mostcountries. Some limited number of countries behave like Italy - for thesecases, if the leading zero(s) of a number would be retained even whendialling internationally, set this flag to true, and also set the number ofleading zeros.<br>Clients who use the parsing functionality of the i18n phonenumber libraries will have these fields set if necessary automatically. |
| `numberOfLeadingZeros` | `integer` | `int32` | 否 |  |
| `rawInput` | `string` | `` | 否 |  | The next few fields are non-essential fields for a phone number. Theyretain extra information about the form the phone number was in when it wasprovided to us to parse. They can be safely ignored by most clients. Topopulate them, call parseAndKeepRawInput on PhoneNumberUtil.<br>This field is used to store the raw input string containing phone numbersbefore it was canonicalized by the library. For example, it could be usedto store alphanumerical numbers such as "1-800-GOOG-411". |
| `countryCodeSource` | `string` | `` | 否 |  | The source from which the country_code is derived. |
| `preferredDomesticCarrierCode` | `string` | `` | 否 |  | The carrier selection code that is preferred when calling this phone numberdomestically. This also includes codes that need to be dialed in somecountries when calling from landlines to mobiles or vice versa. Forexample, in Columbia, a "3" needs to be dialed before the phone numberitself when calling from a mobile phone to a domestic landline phone andvice versa.<br>Note this is the "preferred" code, which means other codes may work aswell. |
