///
/// Because not all users are familiar with the way the Go runtime represents
/// platforms, several normalizations have been provided to make this package
/// easier to user.
///
/// The following are performed for architectures:
///
///   Value    Normalized
///   aarch64  arm64
///   armhf    arm
///   armel    arm/v6
///   i386     386
///   x86_64   amd64
///   x86-64   amd64
///
/// We also normalize the operating system `macos` to `darwin`.
///
/// ARM Support
///
/// To qualify ARM architecture, the Variant field is used to qualify the arm
/// version. The most common arm version, v7, is represented without the variant
/// unless it is explicitly provided. This is treated as equivalent to armhf. A
/// previous architecture, armel, will be normalized to arm/v6.
