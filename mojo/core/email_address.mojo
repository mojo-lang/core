/// The part before the @ symbol (local-part) identifies the name of a mailbox.
/// This is often the username of the recipient, e.g., jsmith.
/// The part after the @ symbol (domain) is a domain name that represents the administrative realm for the mail box,
/// e.g., a company's domain name, example.com.
